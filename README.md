# Yolo_model

Step by step procedure to use the code efficiently:

• To run this program first clone the docker image from: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ekansh18/final

• Next download the pretrained model developed by me from: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UPMq9x-C66PjPPkg65jEaGtgAcYLNbIU?usp=sharing

• Now using the command line type in the required commands from the "Command to Run" file from the repository and put in the required source addresses as per the location where the yolo model file is saved on your pc.

• This API then can be integrated with the "imagedetection_pictorlabs" repository so as to get a website made in React.js using Flask backend out of it.
